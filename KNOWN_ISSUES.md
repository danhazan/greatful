## ⚠️ Active Issues Summary

### 🎭 Emoji Reactions 6 & 7 Not Functioning
**Status**: Active | **Priority**: Medium | **Impact**: User Experience

Emojis 6 (😂) and 7 (🤔) in the emoji picker don't respond when clicked. Backend supports these emojis, but frontend click handlers aren't working.

### 🧪 Backend Test Isolation Issue  
**Status**: Active | **Priority**: Low | **Impact**: Test Coverage Only

Profile API tests pass individually but fail when run with all tests together. No functional impact - all APIs work correctly.

**Workaround**: Run test suites individually or skip profile tests in CI:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/ -k "not test_profile_api"
```

**Status**: Active | **Priority**: Medium | **Impact**: User Experience

Footer elements in CreatePostModal are not properly aligned within the modal container.

### 👤 User Profile Posts Not Displaying
**Status**: Active | **Priority**: High | **Impact**: Core Functionality

User profile pages show "No posts yet" despite having posts (posts count shows correct number).
