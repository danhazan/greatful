# Social Interactions System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows the MVP-focused approach from the PRD, breaking down the social interactions system into testable, incremental units that build upon the existing stable foundation (authentication, navbar, basic posts). Each task represents a working, testable feature that can be demonstrated and validated independently.

The implementation maintains consistency with the reference implementation's purple-themed design (including purple heart emoji üíú for logo and tab icon) and component architecture patterns.

  - Analyze current follow notification patterns and volume for batching opportunities
  - Design user-based batching strategy: batch multiple followers for the same user
  - Define batch key pattern for follow notifications: `follow:user:{user_id}`
  - Design batch summaries: "X people started following you" with expandable individual notifications
  - Plan time-based batching windows (e.g., batch follows within 1-hour windows)

  - Plan implementation of smart batching based on user activity patterns
  - Document advanced batching strategies for future implementation
- [ ] **Test Execution:** Run backend tests to verify follow notification batching logic. Test scenarios with multiple followers in different time windows. Verify batch expansion and individual notification display.
- [ ] **Update Project Documentation:** Document follow notification batching patterns in docs/NOTIFICATION_SYSTEM_REFACTOR.md. Add user-based batching examples to generic batching documentation.
**Acceptance Criteria:** Follow notifications are properly batched when multiple users follow the same person, batch summaries show appropriate counts and can be expanded to show individual followers, and the system integrates seamlessly with the generic batching framework.

## General Guidelines

### Git Commit Requirements
**MANDATORY:** After completing each task and ensuring all tests pass, changes MUST be committed to git with a descriptive commit message. This applies to all tasks that modify code, configuration, or documentation.

**Commit Process:**
1. Complete the task implementation
2. Run and pass all relevant tests (backend/frontend as applicable)
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: [task description] - [brief summary of changes]"`
5. Only then consider the task fully complete

**Commit Message Format:**
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- Include task reference when applicable
- Be descriptive about what was implemented or changed

## Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Every task that changes code or infrastructure MUST include test execution as a completion requirement. Tasks are not considered complete until all relevant tests pass.

### Test Execution Guidelines
- **Backend Changes:** Run `pytest -v` for unit tests, `pytest tests/integration/` for integration tests
- **Frontend Changes:** Run `npm test` for component tests, `npm run test -- tests/api/` for API integration tests
- **Database Changes:** Run backend tests to verify migrations and model changes work correctly
- **Full Stack Changes:** Run both backend (`pytest`) and frontend (`npm test`) test suites
- **Performance Critical Changes:** Include performance tests and benchmarks
- **Mobile/UI Changes:** Run mobile-specific and cross-browser compatibility tests

### Test Failure Protocol
- If tests fail after implementation, fix the issues before marking the task complete
- If persistent errors cannot be resolved, document the issue thoroughly and return to user for guidance
- Never proceed to the next task with failing tests

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Database Schema Priority
1. **emoji_reactions** table with unique constraints
2. **shares** table with rate limiting tracking
3. **mentions** table with post and user relationships

2. **Sharing:** POST `/api/v1/posts/{id}/share`
3. **Search:** POST `/api/v1/users/search`
4. **Notifications:** GET `/api/v1/notifications`, POST `/api/v1/notifications/mark-read`
5. **Follows:** POST/DELETE `/api/v1/follows/{user_id}`

### Frontend Components Priority
1. **EmojiPicker** - Modal with 8 positive emojis
2. **ReactionViewer** - Modal showing all reactions
3. **ShareModal** - Multi-option sharing interface

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Mention Validation Bug Fix (August 28, 2025)

### Problem
- All usernames matching the @username pattern were being highlighted as mentions
- Non-existent users like `@juan` appeared as clickable purple links
- This created confusion as users thought they were mentioning real people

### Solution
- Added `validUsernames` prop to `MentionHighlighter` component
- Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to only highlight usernames in the validation array
- Added username validation to `PostCard` component using existing `validateUsernames` API
- Only real users (validated against database) now get purple highlighting

### Technical Changes
1. **MentionHighlighter.tsx**: Added `validUsernames?: string[]` prop
2. **mentionUtils.ts**: Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to accept and use `validUsernames`
3. **PostCard.tsx**: Added validation logic with `useEffect` to validate mentions against database
4. **Tests**: Updated all tests to reflect new behavior and added integration tests

### Result
- ‚úÖ `@Bob7` (real user) ‚Üí Purple highlighting
- ‚úÖ `@juan` (non-existent user) ‚Üí No highlighting
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (92 mention-related tests)

### Testing
- Updated 19 MentionHighlighter tests
- Updated 29 mentionUtils tests  
- Updated 10 special characters tests
- Added 2 PostCard validation tests
- Added 1 integration test
- All tests now pass successfully

### Behavior
- **Authenticated users**: Mentions are validated against database, only real users get highlighted
- **Unauthenticated users**: No mentions are highlighted (no validation performed)
- **No validUsernames provided**: No mentions are highlighted (backward compatible)
- **Empty validUsernames array**: No mentions are highlighted

**The mention system now provides accurate user feedback and prevents confusion from non-existent user highlights.**
