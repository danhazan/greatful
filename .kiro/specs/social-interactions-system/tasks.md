# Social Interactions System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows the MVP-focused approach from the PRD, breaking down the social interactions system into testable, incremental units that build upon the existing stable foundation (authentication, navbar, basic posts). Each task represents a working, testable feature that can be demonstrated and validated independently.

The implementation maintains consistency with the reference implementation's purple-themed design (including purple heart emoji üíú for logo and tab icon) and component architecture patterns.

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Mention Validation Bug Fix (August 28, 2025)

### Problem
- All usernames matching the @username pattern were being highlighted as mentions
- Non-existent users like `@juan` appeared as clickable purple links
- This created confusion as users thought they were mentioning real people

### Solution
- Added `validUsernames` prop to `MentionHighlighter` component
- Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to only highlight usernames in the validation array
- Added username validation to `PostCard` component using existing `validateUsernames` API
- Only real users (validated against database) now get purple highlighting

### Technical Changes
1. **MentionHighlighter.tsx**: Added `validUsernames?: string[]` prop
2. **mentionUtils.ts**: Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to accept and use `validUsernames`
3. **PostCard.tsx**: Added validation logic with `useEffect` to validate mentions against database
4. **Tests**: Updated all tests to reflect new behavior and added integration tests

### Result
- ‚úÖ `@Bob7` (real user) ‚Üí Purple highlighting
- ‚úÖ `@juan` (non-existent user) ‚Üí No highlighting
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (92 mention-related tests)

### Testing
- Updated 19 MentionHighlighter tests
- Updated 29 mentionUtils tests  
- Updated 10 special characters tests
- Added 2 PostCard validation tests
- Added 1 integration test
- All tests now pass successfully

### Behavior
- **Authenticated users**: Mentions are validated against database, only real users get highlighted
- **Unauthenticated users**: No mentions are highlighted (no validation performed)
- **No validUsernames provided**: No mentions are highlighted (backward compatible)
- **Empty validUsernames array**: No mentions are highlighted

**The mention system now provides accurate user feedback and prevents confusion from non-existent user highlights.**
## ‚úÖ 
COMPLETED: Subsequent Mentions Autocomplete Bug Fix (September 9, 2025)

### Problem
In the contentEditable RichTextEditor, the first mention worked correctly, but subsequent mentions often didn't trigger autocomplete (e.g., typing `@Bob1 gi @b` ‚Äî the `@b` would not show suggestions). Tests passed but real browser usage failed due to fragile text-node/DOM mapping and innerHTML replacement breaking node boundaries, selection mapping, and later detection.

### Root Cause
- **innerHTML Replacement**: The `insertMention()` method was rebuilding the entire editor HTML, which broke DOM node boundaries and selection mapping
- **Fragile Text Detection**: Mention detection relied on `selection.anchorNode.textContent.slice()` which only worked on single text nodes
- **Broken Selection Mapping**: After innerHTML replacement, the cursor position and text node references became invalid
- **Over-aggressive Suppression**: Dropdown was hidden even when cursor was positioned after mentions (not inside them)

### Solution: Range-based DOM Manipulation
Implemented a robust range-based approach that preserves DOM structure and provides accurate text-to-node mapping:

#### 1. **Range-based Mention Insertion**
```typescript
// OLD: innerHTML replacement (fragile)
editableRef.current.innerHTML = sanitizeHtml(htmlWithMentions)

// NEW: Range-based node replacement (robust)
const range = document.createRange()
range.setStart(startNodeInfo.node, startNodeInfo.offset)
range.setEnd(endNodeInfo.node, endNodeInfo.offset)
range.deleteContents()
range.insertNode(mentionSpan)
```

#### 2. **Robust Text Detection**
```typescript
// OLD: Single node text extraction (limited)
const textUpToCursor = nodeText.slice(0, selection.anchorOffset)

// NEW: Range-based full text extraction (accurate)
function getTextUpToCursor(root: HTMLElement): string {
  const range = document.createRange()
  range.setStart(root, 0)
  range.setEnd(selRange.endContainer, selRange.endOffset)
  return range.toString()
}
```

#### 3. **Precise Node Mapping**
```typescript
function getNodeForCharacterOffset(root: HTMLElement, index: number) {
  const walker = document.createTreeWalker(root, NodeFilter.SHOW_TEXT, null)
  let current = walker.nextNode() as Text | null
  let accumulated = 0
  
  while (current) {
    const len = (current.textContent || "").length
    if (accumulated + len >= index) {
      return { node: current, offset: Math.max(0, index - accumulated) }
    }
    accumulated += len
    current = walker.nextNode() as Text | null
  }
  return null
}
```

#### 4. **Improved Suppression Logic**
```typescript
// Only hide dropdown when cursor is truly inside mention element
if (textNode && selection.anchorNode === textNode) {
  const offset = selection.anchorOffset || 0
  if (offset < (textNode.textContent || "").length) {
    isInsideMentionSpan = true // Inside mention
  }
  // If offset is at end, cursor is after mention: don't hide
}
```

### Technical Implementation
1. **Utility Functions**: Added `getNodeForCharacterOffset()`, `getPlainText()`, and `getTextUpToCursor()` for robust DOM-to-text mapping
2. **Range-based Insertion**: Replaced innerHTML manipulation with precise Range operations that preserve DOM structure
3. **Enhanced Detection**: Used Range.toString() for accurate text extraction across multiple nodes
4. **Proper Cursor Positioning**: Used `range.setStartAfter()` and `selection.addRange()` for reliable cursor placement
5. **Mention Span Attributes**: Added `contentEditable="false"` to prevent cursor entering mention spans

### Testing
- **Created comprehensive integration test**: `RichTextEditor.range-based-mentions.test.tsx` with 5 test scenarios
- **Fixed existing test**: Corrected position calculation in `RichTextEditor.mention-replacement.test.tsx`
- **All tests passing**: 37/37 frontend tests, 401/401 backend tests
- **Verified scenarios**:
  - `@Bob1 gi @b` ‚Üí Second mention triggers autocomplete ‚úÖ
  - Multiple mentions with various text between them ‚úÖ
  - Cursor positioning after mention insertion ‚úÖ
  - DOM structure preservation during insertion ‚úÖ
  - Proper suppression when inside vs. after mentions ‚úÖ

### Result
- ‚úÖ **Subsequent mentions work**: `@Bob1 gi @b` now correctly triggers autocomplete for `@b`
- ‚úÖ **DOM structure preserved**: No more innerHTML replacement breaking node boundaries
- ‚úÖ **Accurate text detection**: Range-based approach works across complex DOM structures
- ‚úÖ **Proper cursor positioning**: Cursor reliably positioned after inserted mentions
- ‚úÖ **Improved UX**: Dropdown only hides when truly inside mentions, not after them
- ‚úÖ **All tests passing**: Comprehensive test coverage including edge cases
- ‚úÖ **Backward compatible**: All existing functionality preserved

### Browser Compatibility
The range-based approach uses standard DOM APIs supported by all modern browsers:
- `document.createRange()` - Widely supported
- `document.createTreeWalker()` - Standard DOM traversal
- `range.deleteContents()` / `range.insertNode()` - Standard Range methods
- `selection.addRange()` - Standard Selection API

**The mention system now provides reliable autocomplete for all mentions, regardless of position or surrounding content, with robust DOM manipulation that preserves editor state and structure.**

‚úÖ COMPLETED: Frontend Build Fix & Notification HTML Stripping (September 9, 2025)

### Problems Solved

#### 1. **Frontend Build TypeScript Errors**
- **Error 1**: `Type 'ParentNode | null' is not assignable to type 'Node'` in mention detection loop
- **Error 2**: `Argument of type 'boolean' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'` in execCommand call

#### 2. **Notification HTML Content Issue**
- **Problem**: Mention notifications were displaying raw HTML content instead of plain text
- **Symptom**: Notifications showed `<span class="mention" data-username="Bob">@Bob</span>` instead of `@Bob`
- **Impact**: Poor user experience with unreadable notification content

### Solutions Implemented

#### 1. **TypeScript Build Fixes**
```typescript
// Fixed: Proper null handling in DOM traversal
let currentNode: Node | null = selection.anchorNode
while (currentNode && currentNode !== editableRef.current) {
  // ... logic
  currentNode = currentNode.parentNode // Now properly typed
}

// Fixed: Correct parameter type for execCommand
document.execCommand('styleWithCSS', false, 'true') // String instead of boolean
```

#### 2. **HTML Stripping for Notifications**
```python
def _strip_html_tags(html_content: str) -> str:
    """Strip HTML tags and decode HTML entities to get plain text."""
    if not html_content:
        return ""
    
    # Remove HTML tags using regex
    clean_text = re.sub(r'<[^>]+>', '', html_content)
    
    # Decode HTML entities (like &amp; -> &, &lt; -> <, etc.)
    clean_text = html.unescape(clean_text)
    
    # Clean up extra whitespace
    clean_text = re.sub(r'\s+', ' ', clean_text).strip()
    
    return clean_text

# Updated notification creation
plain_text_preview = _strip_html_tags(post_preview)
notification = Notification(
    message=f'{author_username} mentioned you in a post: {plain_text_preview[:50]}...',
    data={'post_preview': plain_text_preview, ...}
)
```

### Technical Implementation

#### 1. **HTML Stripping Utility**
- **Location**: `apps/api/app/core/notification_factory.py`
- **Function**: `_strip_html_tags(html_content: str) -> str`
- **Features**:
  - Removes all HTML tags using regex `r'<[^>]+>'`
  - Decodes HTML entities using `html.unescape()`
  - Cleans up extra whitespace
  - Handles `None` and empty string inputs gracefully

#### 2. **Notification Factory Updates**
- **Updated**: `create_mention_notification()` method
- **Change**: Post preview is now stripped of HTML before creating notification
- **Benefit**: Both notification message and data contain clean plain text

#### 3. **TypeScript Type Safety**
- **Fixed**: DOM traversal with proper null handling
- **Fixed**: execCommand parameter types
- **Result**: Clean production build without type errors

### Testing

#### 1. **HTML Stripping Tests**
- **File**: `apps/api/tests/unit/test_html_stripping.py`
- **Coverage**: 10 comprehensive test cases
- **Scenarios**:
  - Mention spans removal
  - Multiple HTML tags
  - HTML entity decoding
  - Whitespace cleanup
  - Edge cases (empty, None, plain text)

#### 2. **Integration Tests**
- **File**: `apps/api/tests/integration/test_mention_notification_html_stripping.py`
- **Coverage**: End-to-end notification creation with HTML content
- **Verification**: Notifications contain plain text, not HTML

#### 3. **Build Verification**
- **Frontend**: `npm run build` - ‚úÖ Successful
- **Backend**: All existing tests pass - ‚úÖ 401/401 passing
- **TypeScript**: No type errors - ‚úÖ Clean build

### Results

#### 1. **Before Fix**
```
Notification: "Bob1 mentioned you in a post: <span class="mention" data-username="Bob">@Bob</span>..."
```

#### 2. **After Fix**
```
Notification: "Bob1 mentioned you in a post: @Bob hello world..."
```

### User Experience Impact
- ‚úÖ **Clean Notifications**: Users see readable plain text instead of HTML markup
- ‚úÖ **Proper Mentions**: `@username` displays correctly in notifications
- ‚úÖ **HTML Entities**: Special characters like `&`, `<`, `>` are properly decoded
- ‚úÖ **Production Ready**: Frontend builds successfully without TypeScript errors
- ‚úÖ **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved

### Browser Compatibility
The HTML stripping solution uses standard Python libraries:
- `re` module for regex-based tag removal
- `html.unescape()` for entity decoding
- No external dependencies required

**Both the subsequent mentions autocomplete bug and notification HTML content issues are now fully resolved, providing a seamless user experience across the mention system.**## ‚úÖ COMP
LETED: Character Limit Bug Fix (September 9, 2025)

### Problem
Users were encountering a restrictive 200-character limit for "spontaneous" posts with an error message referencing internal post type mechanisms that shouldn't be user-facing. The system had inconsistent character limits across different components and was enforcing artificial restrictions that hindered user experience.

**Error Message Shown:**
```
"Content too long. Maximum 200 characters for spontaneous posts. Current: 271 characters."
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The system had inconsistent character limits across multiple components:

1. **Frontend CreatePostModal**: `daily: 5000, spontaneous: 200` (with comment to not enforce spontaneous)
2. **Backend ContentAnalysisService**: `daily: 5000, spontaneous: 200`
3. **Backend ContractValidation**: `daily: 500, spontaneous: 200`

The 200-character limit for "spontaneous" posts was an internal classification mechanism that was incorrectly being enforced as a user-facing restriction.

### Solution Implemented

#### 1. **Unified Character Limits**
- **Removed artificial 200-character restriction** for spontaneous posts
- **Implemented universal 5000-character limit** for all text posts
- **Maintained 0-character limit** for photo posts (image-only)

#### 2. **Updated Backend Components**

**Contract Validation (`apps/api/app/core/contract_validation.py`):**
```python
# Before: Inconsistent limits
max_lengths = {
    'daily': 500,
    'photo': 300, 
    'spontaneous': 200
}

# After: Universal limit
max_length = 5000 if post_type != 'photo' else 0
```

**Content Analysis Service (`apps/api/app/services/content_analysis_service.py`):**
```python
# Before: Restrictive spontaneous limit
CHARACTER_LIMITS = {
    PostType.daily: 5000,
    PostType.photo: 0,
    PostType.spontaneous: 200  # Artificial restriction
}

# After: Universal limit
CHARACTER_LIMITS = {
    PostType.daily: 5000,
    PostType.photo: 0,
    PostType.spontaneous: 5000  # Same as daily posts
}
```

#### 3. **Updated Frontend Components**

**CreatePostModal & EditPostModal:**
```typescript
// Before: Inconsistent limits with confusing comment
const CHARACTER_LIMITS = {
  daily: 5000,
  photo: 0,
  spontaneous: 200  // keep for reference/metadata only ‚Äî DO NOT enforce this limit
}

// After: Clear universal limits
const CHARACTER_LIMITS = {
  daily: 5000,      // Universal limit for all text posts
  photo: 0,         // image-only
  spontaneous: 5000 // Same limit as daily posts - no artificial restriction
}
```

#### 4. **Updated Error Messages**
```python
# Before: Confusing post-type-specific messages
f"Content too long for {post_type} post"

# After: Clear universal message
f"Content too long. Maximum {max_length} characters allowed."
```

### Testing & Verification

#### 1. **Comprehensive Test Suite**
Created `test_character_limit_fix.py` with 4 test scenarios:
- ‚úÖ Spontaneous posts accept content > 200 characters (tested with 500 chars)
- ‚úÖ Universal 5000-character limit enforced (tested with 5001 chars failing)
- ‚úÖ Daily posts accept long content up to 5000 characters (tested with 4999 chars)
- ‚úÖ Automatic post type detection still works correctly

#### 2. **Updated Existing Tests**
- Updated 15+ test files to reflect new 5000-character limit
- Fixed API contract tests to use realistic content lengths
- Updated frontend tests to match new validation behavior

#### 3. **Build Verification**
- ‚úÖ Frontend builds successfully without errors
- ‚úÖ Backend tests pass (401/401 passing)
- ‚úÖ API contracts validated
- ‚úÖ Integration tests confirm expected behavior

### User Experience Impact

#### Before Fix:
```
‚ùå User types 271 characters
‚ùå Error: "Content too long. Maximum 200 characters for spontaneous posts"
‚ùå User confused by internal "spontaneous" terminology
‚ùå Artificial restriction blocks legitimate content
```

#### After Fix:
```
‚úÖ User can type up to 5000 characters for any text post
‚úÖ Clear error message: "Content too long. Maximum 5000 characters allowed"
‚úÖ No confusing internal terminology exposed to users
‚úÖ Generous limit supports meaningful gratitude expressions
```

### Technical Benefits

1. **Consistency**: All components now use the same character limits
2. **Simplicity**: Removed complex post-type-specific validation logic
3. **User-Friendly**: No more artificial restrictions on content length
4. **Maintainability**: Single source of truth for character limits
5. **Scalability**: Easy to adjust limits globally in the future

### Backward Compatibility

- ‚úÖ **Existing posts**: All existing posts remain valid (were under 5000 chars)
- ‚úÖ **API contracts**: Maintained same endpoint structure
- ‚úÖ **Post type detection**: Automatic classification still works
- ‚úÖ **Frontend behavior**: UI continues to work as expected

**The character limit system now provides a seamless, user-friendly experience with generous limits that support meaningful gratitude expressions while maintaining system integrity.**
