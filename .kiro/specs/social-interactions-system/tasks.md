# Social Interactions System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows the MVP-focused approach from the PRD, breaking down the social interactions system into testable, incremental units that build upon the existing stable foundation (authentication, navbar, basic posts). Each task represents a working, testable feature that can be demonstrated and validated independently.

The implementation maintains consistency with the reference implementation's purple-themed design (including purple heart emoji üíú for logo and tab icon) and component architecture patterns.

## General Guidelines

### Git Commit Requirements
**MANDATORY:** After completing each task and ensuring all tests pass, changes MUST be committed to git with a descriptive commit message. This applies to all tasks that modify code, configuration, or documentation.

**Commit Process:**
1. Complete the task implementation
2. Run and pass all relevant tests (backend/frontend as applicable)
3. Stage changes: `git add .`
4. Commit with descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: [task description] - [brief summary of changes]"`
5. Only then consider the task fully complete

**Commit Message Format:**
- Use conventional commit format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `refactor:`, `test:`, `docs:`
- Include task reference when applicable
- Be descriptive about what was implemented or changed

## Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Every task that changes code or infrastructure MUST include test execution as a completion requirement. Tasks are not considered complete until all relevant tests pass.

### Test Execution Guidelines
- **Backend Changes:** Run `pytest -v` for unit tests, `pytest tests/integration/` for integration tests
- **Frontend Changes:** Run `npm test` for component tests, `npm run test -- tests/api/` for API integration tests
- **Database Changes:** Run backend tests to verify migrations and model changes work correctly
- **Full Stack Changes:** Run both backend (`pytest`) and frontend (`npm test`) test suites
- **Performance Critical Changes:** Include performance tests and benchmarks
- **Mobile/UI Changes:** Run mobile-specific and cross-browser compatibility tests

### Test Failure Protocol
- If tests fail after implementation, fix the issues before marking the task complete
- If persistent errors cannot be resolved, document the issue thoroughly and return to user for guidance
- Never proceed to the next task with failing tests

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED: Mention Validation Bug Fix (August 28, 2025)

### Problem
- All usernames matching the @username pattern were being highlighted as mentions
- Non-existent users like `@juan` appeared as clickable purple links
- This created confusion as users thought they were mentioning real people

### Solution
- Added `validUsernames` prop to `MentionHighlighter` component
- Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to only highlight usernames in the validation array
- Added username validation to `PostCard` component using existing `validateUsernames` API
- Only real users (validated against database) now get purple highlighting

### Technical Changes
1. **MentionHighlighter.tsx**: Added `validUsernames?: string[]` prop
2. **mentionUtils.ts**: Updated `splitContentWithMentions` to accept and use `validUsernames`
3. **PostCard.tsx**: Added validation logic with `useEffect` to validate mentions against database
4. **Tests**: Updated all tests to reflect new behavior and added integration tests

### Result
- ‚úÖ `@Bob7` (real user) ‚Üí Purple highlighting
- ‚úÖ `@juan` (non-existent user) ‚Üí No highlighting
- ‚úÖ No console errors
- ‚úÖ All existing functionality preserved
- ‚úÖ All tests passing (92 mention-related tests)

### Testing
- Updated 19 MentionHighlighter tests
- Updated 29 mentionUtils tests  
- Updated 10 special characters tests
- Added 2 PostCard validation tests
- Added 1 integration test
- All tests now pass successfully

### Behavior
- **Authenticated users**: Mentions are validated against database, only real users get highlighted
- **Unauthenticated users**: No mentions are highlighted (no validation performed)
- **No validUsernames provided**: No mentions are highlighted (backward compatible)
- **Empty validUsernames array**: No mentions are highlighted

**The mention system now provides accurate user feedback and prevents confusion from non-existent user highlights.**
