# Social Interactions System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows the MVP-focused approach from the PRD, breaking down the social interactions system into testable, incremental units that build upon the existing stable foundation (authentication, navbar, basic posts). Each task represents a working, testable feature that can be demonstrated and validated independently.

The implementation maintains consistency with the reference implementation's purple-themed design (including purple heart emoji üíú for logo and tab icon) and component architecture patterns.

## Testing Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Every task that changes code or infrastructure MUST include test execution as a completion requirement. Tasks are not considered complete until all relevant tests pass.

### Test Execution Guidelines
- **Backend Changes:** Run `pytest -v` for unit tests, `pytest tests/integration/` for integration tests
- **Frontend Changes:** Run `npm test` for component tests, `npm run test -- tests/api/` for API integration tests
- **Database Changes:** Run backend tests to verify migrations and model changes work correctly
- **Full Stack Changes:** Run both backend (`pytest`) and frontend (`npm test`) test suites
- **Performance Critical Changes:** Include performance tests and benchmarks
- **Mobile/UI Changes:** Run mobile-specific and cross-browser compatibility tests

### Test Failure Protocol
- If tests fail after implementation, fix the issues before marking the task complete
- If persistent errors cannot be resolved, document the issue thoroughly and return to user for guidance
- Never proceed to the next task with failing tests
