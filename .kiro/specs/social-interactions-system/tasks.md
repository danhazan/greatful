# Social Interactions System - Implementation Plan

## Overview

This implementation plan follows the MVP-focused approach from the PRD, breaking down the social interactions system into testable, incremental units that build upon the existing stable foundation (authentication, navbar, basic posts). Each task represents a working, testable feature that can be demonstrated and validated independently.

The implementation maintains consistency with the reference implementation's purple-themed design (including purple heart emoji üíú for logo and tab icon) and component architecture patterns.
