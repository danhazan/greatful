Everytime a task is completed, which changed the code or infrastructure, you should run tests for frontend / backend / both (depending on the change) to ensure that the change didn't break them.
If the tests don't pass, fix the problems until they all pass.
if there is a persistent error that you can't solve, explain it thoroughly and return to the user.
