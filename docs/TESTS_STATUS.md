# Test Status Documentation

## Overview

This document tracks all skipped tests across the project, providing detailed explanations for why tests are disabled and when they should be re-enabled.

## Backend Tests (FastAPI)

### ✅ All Backend Tests Passing

**Location**: `apps/api/tests/`  
**Status**: All 330 tests passing  
**Impact**: Backend API fully tested and functional  

#### Recently Fixed Issues:

1. **Profile API Test Failures** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: `test_update_profile_username_taken` failed due to missing `hashed_password` in test user creation
   - **Fix**: Added proper password hashing in test user creation
   - **Issue**: `test_get_user_profile_success` failed because email was exposed in public profile endpoint
   - **Fix**: Created separate `PublicUserProfileResponse` model that excludes email for other users' profiles

2. **HTTP Status Code Mismatch** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: Test expected 400 but API returned 409 for username conflict
   - **Fix**: Updated test to expect correct 409 Conflict status code

#### Current Status:
```bash
# All tests pass
cd apps/api
source venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -v
# Result: 330 passed, 25 warnings (datetime deprecation)
```
**Note on Warnings**: The warnings are `DeprecationWarning` from datetime.utcnow() usage in algorithm service and test files. These are scheduled for future updates to use timezone-aware datetime objects but do not affect test functionality.

## Frontend Tests (Next.js/React)

### ✅ Authentication E2E Tests Added

**Location**: `apps/web/src/tests/auth/`  
**Status**: 16 comprehensive E2E tests passing  
**Impact**: Authentication flows fully tested and functional  

#### New Authentication Test Coverage:

1. **Signup Page Tests** - ADDED
   - Form rendering and validation attributes
   - Successful user registration with token handling
   - Client-side validation (password match, length)
   - Server error handling (validation errors, network failures)
   - Accessibility compliance (labels, ARIA attributes)

2. **Login Page Tests** - ADDED
   - Form rendering and validation attributes
   - Successful authentication with token storage
   - Error handling (invalid credentials, network failures)
   - Accessibility compliance

3. **Integration Flow Tests** - ADDED
   - Complete signup → login flow with same credentials
   - Cross-form navigation (login ↔ signup links)
   - Demo page navigation
   - Token management and storage

#### Test Results:
```bash
# Authentication E2E tests
cd apps/web
npm test -- --testPathPattern=auth-e2e-simple
# Result: 16 passed, 0 failed (with React act() warnings)
```

**Note on React act() Warnings**: The tests show React `act()` warnings for form input state updates. These are non-blocking warnings that indicate best practices for test reliability but do not affect test functionality. The warnings occur because `userEvent.type()` triggers state updates that should ideally be wrapped in `act()`.

### Skipped Frontend Tests

**Status**: 12 tests skipped across 1 test suite  
**Impact**: Specific functionalities are not fully tested, but significantly improved from previous 49 skipped tests.  

#### Current Skipped Tests (LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx):

**Entire `LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx` suite** - 12 tests skipped
- **Location**: `src/tests/components/LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx`
- **Complexity**: High - Complex toast notification system testing
- **Priority**: Low - Non-critical UI polish feature
- **Reason**: Complex toast notification system testing with timing and state management
- **Technical Challenges**:
  - Portal-based rendering makes DOM queries complex in JSDOM
  - Animation timing and `requestAnimationFrame` behavior in test environment
  - Toast lifecycle management (show → auto-hide → cleanup)
  - Multiple toast interaction and stacking behavior
  - Error state and retry mechanism testing

#### Remaining Skipped Test Analysis:

**LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx** (12 tests):
- **Business Impact**: Low - Toast notifications are UI polish, not core functionality
- **User Impact**: Minimal - Toasts provide feedback but don't block user actions
- **Technical Complexity**: High - Portal rendering, animations, timing
- **Fix Effort**: Medium-High - Requires specialized test utilities for portal testing
- **Priority Justification**: Low priority because:
  - Toast functionality works correctly in production
  - Core toast behavior is tested in integration tests
  - Main app functionality doesn't depend on toast system
  - Visual feedback is secondary to functional operations

#### General Fixes Required for Skipped Frontend Tests:
-   **Comprehensive Mocking**: Ensure all external dependencies, API calls, and global states are properly mocked.
-   **`act()` Wrapping**: Wrap all state updates and user interactions in `act()` to ensure React updates are flushed.
-   **Asynchronous Testing**: Use `waitFor`, `findBy`, and `await` for testing asynchronous operations and real-time updates.
-   **Test Utilities**: Develop or utilize existing test utilities for common patterns like modal interactions, keyboard events, and image loading.
-   **Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other.

### Frontend (Next.js)
- **Total**: 563 tests
- **Passing**: 551 tests (97.9%)
- **Failing**: 0 tests (0%)
- **Skipped**: 12 tests (2.1%)
- **Test Suites**: 56 passed, 1 skipped (57 total)

### Authentication E2E Tests (New)
- **Total**: 16 tests

## Priority Fix Order

### High Priority (Quality Improvement)
1. **React `act()` Warnings** - Wrap async state updates in act() for test reliability
   - **Status**: In progress - Authentication tests show these warnings but are functional
   - **Impact**: Test reliability and best practices compliance
   - **Effort**: Medium - Requires wrapping user interactions in act()

### Low Priority (Polish)
2. **LoadingStates Tests** - Re-enable toast notification testing (12 tests)
   - **Status**: Skipped - Complex portal-based rendering and animation timing
   - **Impact**: Minimal - UI polish feature, not core functionality
   - **Effort**: High - Requires specialized portal testing utilities
   - **Justification**: Toast system works in production, low business impact

### ✅ Recently Completed (No Longer Priorities)
