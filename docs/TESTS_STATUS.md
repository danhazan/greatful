# Test Status Documentation

## Overview

This document tracks all skipped tests across the project, providing detailed explanations for why tests are disabled and when they should be re-enabled.

## Backend Tests (FastAPI)

### ✅ All Backend Tests Passing

**Location**: `apps/api/tests/`  
**Status**: All 330 tests passing  
**Impact**: Backend API fully tested and functional  

#### Recently Fixed Issues:

1. **Profile API Test Failures** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: `test_update_profile_username_taken` failed due to missing `hashed_password` in test user creation
   - **Fix**: Added proper password hashing in test user creation
   - **Issue**: `test_get_user_profile_success` failed because email was exposed in public profile endpoint
   - **Fix**: Created separate `PublicUserProfileResponse` model that excludes email for other users' profiles

2. **HTTP Status Code Mismatch** - FIXED
   - **Issue**: Test expected 400 but API returned 409 for username conflict
   - **Fix**: Updated test to expect correct 409 Conflict status code

#### Current Status:
```bash
# All tests pass
cd apps/api
source venv/bin/activate
PYTHONPATH=. pytest -v
# Result: 330 passed, 25 warnings (datetime deprecation)
```
**Note on Warnings**: The warnings are `DeprecationWarning` from datetime.utcnow() usage in algorithm service and test files. These are scheduled for future updates to use timezone-aware datetime objects but do not affect test functionality.

## Frontend Tests (Next.js/React)

### Skipped Frontend Tests

**Status**: 16 tests skipped across 6 test suites  
**Impact**: Specific functionalities are not fully tested.  

#### Skipped Tests:

1.  **`should not modify global counts when user reacts`** (from `src/app/feed/__tests__/counter-integration.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Complex mocking of global state and localStorage interactions in feed component.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement robust mocking for global state and ensure proper isolation of test environment.

2.  **`should save individual user reactions to user-specific localStorage`** (from `src/app/feed/__tests__/counter-integration.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Complex mocking of `localStorage` and user-specific data handling in feed context.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement proper mocking for `localStorage` and ensure test data is isolated per user.

3.  **`renders notification bell with unread count`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Likely related to complex UI rendering based on dynamic data or incomplete mocking of notification data.
    -   **Fix Required**: Ensure all necessary props and data are mocked for the component to render correctly.

4.  **`shows notifications dropdown when bell is clicked`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves user interaction and state changes that might not be fully covered by current test setup.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement proper event simulation and `act()` wrapping for state updates.

5.  **`marks notification as read when clicked`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves user interaction and API calls that might not be fully mocked or handled in the test environment.
    -   **Fix Required**: Mock API calls for marking notifications as read and ensure correct event handling.

6.  **`marks all notifications as read`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Similar to the above, involves API calls and state updates for multiple notifications.
    -   **Fix Required**: Mock API calls for marking all notifications as read and handle bulk state updates.

7.  **`displays correct notification icons`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Related to conditional rendering of UI elements based on notification types or data.
    -   **Fix Required**: Ensure all possible notification types and their corresponding icons are covered by mocks.

8.  **`shows user avatars with fallback to initials`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves image loading and fallback logic, which can be complex to test in a JSDOM environment.
    -   **Fix Required**: Mock image loading and ensure fallback logic is correctly triggered in tests.

9.  **`handles API errors gracefully`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Requires mocking API errors and verifying the component's response to them.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement robust API error mocking and assert on error handling UI/logic.

10. **`formats time correctly`** (from `src/tests/components/NotificationSystem.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves date formatting and localization, which can be tricky in tests.
    -   **Fix Required**: Use consistent date mocking and ensure formatting logic is correctly applied.

11. **`should handle reaction removal and update count in real-time`** (from `src/tests/components/PostCard.reactions.realtime.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves real-time updates and potentially WebSocket mocking, similar to previous documentation.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement WebSocket mocking and ensure real-time updates are correctly reflected in the UI.

12. **`should fallback to optimistic update if reaction summary fetch fails`** (from `src/tests/components/PostCard.reactions.realtime.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves complex optimistic UI updates and error handling for API calls.
    -   **Fix Required**: Mock API failures and verify the optimistic update logic.

13. **`should handle API errors gracefully`** (from `src/tests/components/PostCard.reactions.realtime.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Requires mocking API errors and verifying the component's response to them.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement robust API error mocking and assert on error handling UI/logic.

14. **`positions correctly based on provided position`** (from `src/tests/components/EmojiPicker.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Involves DOM manipulation and precise positioning, which can be challenging in a JSDOM environment.
    -   **Fix Required**: Use testing utilities that can accurately simulate DOM layout and positioning.

15. **Entire `LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx` suite** (from `src/tests/components/LoadingStatesAndToasts.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Complex toast notification system testing with timing and state management.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement proper async testing patterns and toast state mocking.

16. **Entire `FollowButton-advanced.test.tsx` suite** (from `src/tests/components/FollowButton-advanced.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Advanced follow button interactions requiring complex state management and API mocking.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement comprehensive mocking for follow status and user interactions.

17. **`Error Handling` describe block** (from `src/tests/components/FollowButton.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Error handling scenarios requiring complex API failure simulation.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement robust error mocking and recovery testing patterns.

18. **`Follow Button Error Recovery` describe block** (from `src/tests/integration/follow-interactions.test.tsx`)
    -   **Reason**: Integration testing of error recovery flows with network failures.
    -   **Fix Required**: Implement network error simulation and recovery flow testing.

#### General Fixes Required for Skipped Frontend Tests:
-   **Comprehensive Mocking**: Ensure all external dependencies, API calls, and global states are properly mocked.
-   **`act()` Wrapping**: Wrap all state updates and user interactions in `act()` to ensure React updates are flushed.
-   **Asynchronous Testing**: Use `waitFor`, `findBy`, and `await` for testing asynchronous operations and real-time updates.
-   **Test Utilities**: Develop or utilize existing test utilities for common patterns like modal interactions, keyboard events, and image loading.
-   **Isolation**: Ensure tests are isolated and do not interfere with each other.
