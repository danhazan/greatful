# Read Status Testing Scenario

This document provides a step-by-step manual testing scenario to demonstrate how the read status mechanism works in the Grateful app.

## üéØ Scenario Overview

**User Story**: Alice wants to see fresh content in her feed and avoid seeing the same posts repeatedly.

**Test Goal**: Demonstrate how read status affects feed ranking and content discovery.

## üìã Prerequisites

1. Backend server running on `http://localhost:8000`
2. Frontend server running on `http://localhost:3000`
3. At least 2 test users with some posts created
4. API testing tool (Postman, curl, or browser dev tools)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Test Scenario

### Step 1: Setup Test Data

Create test users and posts using the API or frontend:

**Users:**
- Alice (primary test user)
- Bob (content creator)
- Charlie (content creator)

**Posts:** Create 5-6 posts with different timestamps:
- 2-3 older posts (created 2+ hours ago)
- 2-3 newer posts (created within last hour)

### Step 2: Initial Feed Load

**Action:** Get Alice's initial feed
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/feed?limit=10&consider_read_status=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Newer posts should appear higher in the feed
- All posts should have `"is_read": false` and `"is_unread": true/false` based on timestamps
- Posts created after Alice's `last_feed_view` should have `"is_unread": true`

**What to Look For:**
```json
{
  "posts": [
    {
      "id": "new-post-1",
      "content": "Recent post",
      "algorithm_score": 85.2,
      "is_read": false,
      "is_unread": true,
      "created_at": "2025-09-14T18:30:00Z"
    },
    {
      "id": "old-post-1", 
      "content": "Older post",
      "algorithm_score": 12.4,
      "is_read": false,
      "is_unread": false,
      "created_at": "2025-09-14T15:30:00Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Step 3: Mark Posts as Read

**Action:** Simulate Alice reading the first 2 posts
```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/read-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "post_ids": ["new-post-1", "old-post-1"]
  }'
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Marked 2 posts as read",
  "read_count": 2,
  "post_ids": ["new-post-1", "old-post-1"]
}
```

### Step 4: Refresh Feed

**Action:** Get Alice's feed again
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/feed?limit=10&consider_read_status=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Previously read posts should have lower `algorithm_score` values
- Read posts should have `"is_read": true`
- Unread posts should rank higher than read posts
- Feed order should change to prioritize unread content

**Score Comparison:**
- Unread posts: Higher scores (boosted by 3x)
- Read posts: Lower scores (penalized by ~0.33x)

### Step 5: Test Read Status Disabled

**Action:** Get feed with read status disabled
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/feed?limit=10&consider_read_status=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Results:**
- All posts should have `"is_read": false`
- Scores should be based only on engagement and time factors
- Feed order may differ from read-status-enabled version

### Step 6: Test Refresh Mode

**Action:** Get feed in refresh mode
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/feed?limit=10&consider_read_status=true&refresh=true" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Results:**
- Unread posts should dominate the top positions
- Read posts should be further deprioritized
- Fresh content should be strongly prioritized

### Step 7: Check Read Status Summary

**Action:** Get read status summary
```bash
curl -X GET "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/read-status/summary" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "read_count": 2,
    "recent_reads": [
      {
        "post_id": "new-post-1",
        "read_at": "2025-09-14T19:15:30.123Z"
      },
      {
        "post_id": "old-post-1", 
        "read_at": "2025-09-14T19:15:30.456Z"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Step 8: Clear Read Status

**Action:** Clear all read status
```bash
curl -X DELETE "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/posts/read-status" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <alice_token>"
```

**Expected Response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Read status cleared successfully"
}
```

**Verification:** Get feed again - all posts should show as unread

## üîç Key Observations to Make

### 1. Score Impact
- **Unread posts**: Get 3x boost (unread_boost = 3.0)
- **Read posts**: Get ~0.33x penalty (1/unread_boost)
- **Score difference**: Should be ~9x between unread and read posts

### 2. Feed Ranking Changes
- **Before reading**: Posts ranked by engagement + time + content type
- **After reading**: Read posts drop significantly in ranking
- **Refresh mode**: Even stronger prioritization of unread content

### 3. Metadata Accuracy
- `is_read`: Reflects session-based read tracking
- `is_unread`: Reflects timestamp-based unread detection
- `algorithm_score`: Shows the impact of read status multipliers

### 4. API Consistency
- Read status persists within the session
- Bulk operations work correctly
- Summary provides accurate statistics

## üß™ Advanced Testing Scenarios

### Scenario A: Mixed Content Types
Test with different post types (daily, photo, spontaneous) to see how read status interacts with content bonuses.

### Scenario B: High Engagement Posts
Test with posts that have many hearts/reactions to see if read status can overcome high engagement scores.

### Scenario C: Time-based Transitions
Test posts that transition from "unread by timestamp" to "read by timestamp" as time passes.

### Scenario D: Multiple Users
Test read status isolation between different users to ensure no cross-contamination.

## üìä Expected Performance Metrics

- **Feed generation time**: Should remain <300ms even with read status processing
- **Read status API calls**: Should complete in <50ms
- **Memory usage**: Read status cache should be reasonable for typical session sizes

## üö® Common Issues to Watch For

1. **Score calculation errors**: Verify multipliers are applied correctly
2. **Timestamp handling**: Ensure timezone-aware comparisons work
3. **Cache consistency**: Read status should persist throughout session
4. **API validation**: Invalid post IDs should be handled gracefully
5. **Performance impact**: Read status shouldn't significantly slow down feeds

## ‚úÖ Success Criteria

The read status mechanism is working correctly if:

1. ‚úÖ Unread posts consistently rank higher than read posts
2. ‚úÖ Read posts show significant score reduction (~3x penalty)
3. ‚úÖ API endpoints respond correctly and update state
4. ‚úÖ Read status can be disabled without breaking feeds
5. ‚úÖ Refresh mode provides stronger unread prioritization
6. ‚úÖ Performance remains within acceptable limits
7. ‚úÖ User isolation prevents cross-user read status leakage

## üéØ Real-World Usage Patterns

This mechanism supports these user behaviors:

- **Content Discovery**: Users see fresh content first
- **Reduced Repetition**: Already-seen posts are deprioritized
- **Engagement Maintenance**: High-quality read posts can still appear
- **Session Continuity**: Read status persists during browsing session
- **Flexible Control**: Can be disabled for chronological browsing

The read status system enhances user experience by promoting content discovery while maintaining engagement with quality posts.
