# Known Issues and Solutions

## Issue #1: NextAuth Route Export Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
```
Type error: Route "src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts" does not match the required types of a Next.js Route.
"authOptions" is not a valid Route export field.
```

### Root Cause
In Next.js App Router, API routes can only export specific handler functions (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.). Exporting additional variables like `authOptions` is not allowed and causes build failures.

### Solution
**✅ Fixed**: Removed the `export` keyword from `authOptions` declaration.

**Before:**
```typescript
export const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  // ... config
}
```

**After:**
```typescript
const authOptions: NextAuthOptions = {
  // ... config
}
```

### Why This Happens
- Next.js App Router enforces strict export rules for API routes
- Only HTTP method handlers can be exported from route files
- Configuration objects should be internal to the route file
- This is a common issue when migrating from Pages Router to App Router

### Prevention
- Always use `const` instead of `export const` for configuration objects in API routes
- Only export HTTP method handlers (`GET`, `POST`, etc.)
- Keep configuration objects internal to route files

## Issue #2: Next.js 15 Dynamic Route Params Error ✅ FIXED

### Problem
```
Error: Route "/api/posts/[id]/hearts" used `params.id`. `params` should be awaited before using its properties.
```

### Root Cause
In Next.js 15 App Router, the `params` argument for route handlers is now always a plain object, not a Promise. The handler signature should destructure `params` directly, not await it. Using the old pattern (from catch-all API routes) causes runtime errors.

### Solution
**✅ Fixed**: Use the correct handler signature and destructure `params` directly.

**Before (incorrect):**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, params: Promise<{ params: { id: string } }>) {
  const resolvedParams = await params
  const { id } = resolvedParams.params
  // ...
}
```

**After (correct):**
```typescript
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  const { id } = params
  // ...
}
```

### Why This Happens
- Next.js 15 App Router made route parameters always synchronous objects
- Awaiting or treating `params` as a Promise is a legacy pattern from old API routes
- This is a breaking change from Next.js 14 and earlier

### Prevention
- Always use `{ params }: { params: { ... } }` in the handler signature
- Never await `params` in App Router route handlers
- Check Next.js migration guides for breaking changes

## Issue #3: TypeScript/ESLint Errors

### Problem
Multiple TypeScript and ESLint errors during build:
- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any` - Using `any` type
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars` - Unused variables
- `react/no-unescaped-entities` - Unescaped apostrophes
- `@next/next/no-img-element` - Using `<img>` instead of Next.js `<Image>`
- `@typescript-eslint/ban-ts-comment` - Using `@ts-ignore` instead of `@ts-expect-error`

### Root Cause
Strict TypeScript and ESLint configuration catching code quality issues.

### Solution
**Status**: Needs cleanup

**Quick Fixes Needed:**
1. **Replace `any` types** with proper TypeScript types
2. **Remove unused variables** or mark them with `_` prefix
3. **Escape apostrophes** in JSX text
4. **Replace `<img>` with Next.js `<Image>` component**
5. **Use `@ts-expect-error` instead of `@ts-ignore`**

### Why This Happens
- Strict TypeScript configuration for better code quality
- ESLint rules enforcing best practices
- Common issues in rapid development

### Prevention
- Use proper TypeScript types instead of `any`
- Clean up unused imports and variables
- Follow React/Next.js best practices
- Use proper TypeScript comment directives

## Issue #4: Multiple Lockfiles Warning

### Problem
```
Warning: Found multiple lockfiles. Selecting /home/danha/package-lock.json.
Consider removing the lockfiles at:
* /home/danha/Projects/Cursor/grateful/apps/web/package-lock.json
```

### Root Cause
The project has multiple `package-lock.json` files - one at the root and one in the web app directory. This can cause dependency conflicts and build issues.

### Solution
**Status**: Needs manual cleanup

**Recommended Action:**
1. Remove the root-level `package-lock.json` if it's not needed
2. Keep only the lockfile in the specific app directory
3. Run `npm install` to regenerate clean lockfiles

### Why This Happens
- Monorepo structure with multiple package.json files
- npm creates lockfiles at each level where `npm install` is run
- Can cause dependency version conflicts

### Prevention
- Use consistent package management (npm, yarn, or pnpm)
- Run install commands only in the specific app directories
- Consider using workspace tools like Lerna or Nx for monorepo management

## Frontend Test Issues

### ✅ RESOLVED: Test Framework Conflict

**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Vitest completely removed, Jest unified as test framework

**Previous Issue**: 
- Vitest cannot be imported in a CommonJS module using require(). Please use "import" instead.
- Frontend tests were using Vitest imports but Jest was configured in the project.

**Solution Applied**:
1. **Removed Vitest completely**: Uninstalled `vitest` package and all dependencies
2. **Converted all tests to Jest**: Updated all test files to use `@jest/globals` imports
3. **Unified test framework**: All tests now use Jest consistently
4. **Fixed mock functions**: Replaced `vi.fn()` with `jest.fn()` throughout

**Current Status**: ✅ **All tests now use Jest framework consistently**

### Remaining Test Issues

**Status**: 🔄 **IN PROGRESS** - Some tests still need dependency mocking

**Current Issues**:
1. **API Route Tests**: Next.js Request/Response not properly mocked
2. **Page Component Tests**: Missing component dependencies
3. **Integration Tests**: Complex dependencies not mocked

**Progress**: 50% of test suites passing (4/8 tests working)

---

## Backend Integration Tests

### Problem
```
TypeError: object Response can't be used in 'await' expression
```

### Root Cause
Integration tests are using `async_client` incorrectly with `await` syntax.

### Solution
**Status**: Known issue, low priority

**Impact**: All unit tests (86/86) pass, only integration tests affected
**Priority**: Low - Unit tests cover all functionality

### Why This Happens
- Async/await syntax mismatch in test client usage
- Integration tests need different async handling than unit tests
- Test client configuration issue

### Prevention
- Use consistent async patterns across all tests
- Test integration test syntax before implementing
- Separate unit and integration test configurations

## Issue #7: Legacy Params Pattern Workaround (Temporary)

### Problem
To avoid runtime errors in dynamic API routes (e.g., `/api/posts/[id]/hearts`), the handler signature is reverted to the legacy form:

```ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, params: any) {
  const { id } = params?.params || {}
  // ...
}
```

### Why This Is Used
- Next.js 15 App Router has breaking changes in how params are passed to API route handlers.
- The new recommended signature sometimes causes runtime errors in certain environments or with certain Next.js versions.
- The legacy pattern (`params: any` and `params?.params?.id`) is the most compatible and least error-prone for now.

### Tradeoffs
- This is not the recommended pattern for long-term maintenance.
- Type safety is lost (using `any`).
- May need to be updated again after Next.js or framework upgrades.

### When to Use
- Use this pattern if you encounter persistent errors with the new handler signature and need a quick, stable workaround.
- Revisit and refactor to the recommended signature when the framework stabilizes or after a Next.js upgrade.

### Example
```ts
export async function GET(request: NextRequest, params: any) {
  const { id } = params?.params || {}
  // ...
}
```

## File Renames

### PRD File
- **Before**: `docs/grateful_prd.md`
- **After**: `docs/GRATEFUL_PRD.md`
- **Reason**: Consistent uppercase naming convention for documentation files
