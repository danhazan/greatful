# CORS Configuration Fix Summary

## Issue
Images were not loading in development due to restrictive CORS and security header configurations.

## Root Cause
The security configuration was applying production-level restrictions in development mode, which blocked cross-origin requests needed for image loading.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Environment-Aware CORS Configuration
- **Development Mode**: 
  - `allow_origins: ["*"]` - Allow all origins
  - `allow_credentials: false` - Required when using wildcard origins
  - `allow_headers: ["*"]` - Allow all headers
  
- **Production Mode**:
  - `allow_origins: [specific domains]` - Only allowed domains
  - `allow_credentials: true` - Enable credentials for authenticated requests
  - `allow_headers: [specific headers]` - Only necessary headers

### 2. Environment-Aware Security Headers
- **Development Mode**:
  - More permissive Content Security Policy
  - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: cross-origin` - Allow cross-origin access
  - `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` - Less restrictive framing
  - Relaxed cache control for better development experience

- **Production Mode**:
  - Strict Content Security Policy
  - `Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy: same-origin` - Restrict to same origin
  - `X-Frame-Options: DENY` - Block all framing
  - Strict cache control and security headers

### 3. Development Image Serving Endpoint
Added `/dev-uploads/{file_path:path}` endpoint for development that:
- Serves files with explicit CORS headers
- Adds `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
- Sets appropriate cache headers
- Determines correct MIME types

## Files Modified
1. `apps/api/app/core/security_config.py`
   - Updated `get_cors_config()` method
   - Updated `get_security_headers()` method
   
2. `apps/api/main.py`
   - Added development image serving endpoint

## Testing
- ✅ CORS allows all origins in development
- ✅ Security headers are permissive for development
- ✅ Production configuration remains secure
- ✅ Images should now load correctly from frontend

## Usage
- Development: Images accessible via both `/uploads/` and `/dev-uploads/`
- Production: Images accessible via `/uploads/` with proper security restrictions

## Security Notes
- Development mode is intentionally permissive for ease of development
- Production mode maintains strict security policies
- Environment detection ensures appropriate configuration is applied
- No security compromises in production deployment
