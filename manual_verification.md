# Manual Verification Steps for Background Styles Fix

## Summary
This document outlines the manual verification steps to confirm that the background styles and white text fix is working correctly.

## Changes Made

1. **RichTextEditor**: Applied background styles to a wrapper element with transparent contenteditable area that inherits color
2. **CreatePostModal**: Always includes `post_style` and `rich_content` in the payload
3. **RichContentRenderer**: Prefers explicit `post_style.textColor` over computed color
4. **Tests**: Updated to use computed colors via colorUtils instead of hardcoded values

## Manual Verification Steps

### 1. Create Post with Dark Background
1. Open the create post modal
2. Select a dark background style (e.g., "Elegant Dark")
3. Type some text - verify it shows white/light text immediately while typing
4. Apply some formatting (bold, italic) - verify text remains visible
5. Submit the post

### 2. Verify Published Post
1. Check that the published post in the feed shows the correct background and text color
2. Verify that formatted text (bold, italic) is visible and readable
3. Check that the text color is appropriate for the background (white for dark, dark for light)

### 3. Edit Post
1. Edit the post you just created
2. Verify the edit modal shows the same background and text color as when creating
3. Make some changes and save
4. Verify the updated post displays correctly in the feed

### 4. Test Different Styles
1. Try creating posts with different background styles:
   - Light backgrounds (should show dark text)
   - Dark backgrounds (should show light text)
   - Gradient backgrounds (should compute appropriate text color)

### 5. Debug Checklist (if issues occur)

#### Check Network Requests
1. Open browser dev tools → Network tab
2. Create a post with dark background
3. Check the POST request to `/api/posts`:
   - Verify `post_style` field is present with correct colors
   - Verify `rich_content` field contains formatted HTML

#### Check API Response
1. Check the response from POST `/api/posts`:
   - Verify response includes `post_style` and `rich_content`
   - Verify the data matches what was sent

#### Check Feed Data
1. Check GET `/api/posts` or feed endpoint:
   - Verify posts include `post_style` and `rich_content` fields
   - Verify the data persisted correctly

## Expected Results

- ✅ Dark backgrounds show light text while typing
- ✅ Light backgrounds show dark text while typing  
- ✅ Published posts maintain correct text/background contrast
- ✅ Edit modal shows same styling as create modal
- ✅ Formatted text (bold, italic) remains visible on all backgrounds
- ✅ All tests pass

## Troubleshooting

If text is not visible:
1. Check that the wrapper element has the background style applied
2. Check that the contenteditable element has `color: inherit`
3. Verify the `post_style` data is being sent and received correctly
4. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors

If styles don't persist:
1. Verify the backend is saving `post_style` to the database
2. Check that the API response includes the style data
3. Verify the RichContentRenderer is receiving and applying the styles
